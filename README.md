# probot-spellchecker

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that runs a spellchecker against markdown files

I based this on [urcomputeringpal/yamburger](https://github.com/urcomputeringpal/yamburger/) to get a handle on how to use Probot with GitHub's checks API

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run typescript
npm run build

# Run the bot
npm start
```
